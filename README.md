# VOC - Sistema de Conciliaciones

Comprehensive document management and reconciliation system built with modern technologies and monorepo architecture for efficient development and deployment.

## Project Overview

VOC is a full-stack web application that enables efficient management of users, document uploads, dashboard visualization, and permission administration. The system is designed to facilitate reconciliation processes and document tracking with a focus on security, scalability, and maintainability.

## Monorepo Architecture

This project uses npm workspaces to create a unified development environment with shared dependencies and streamlined workflows.
